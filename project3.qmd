Who is doing what research question:

Tiannah - During which time period did hospitalizations peak and how have recovery rates changed over time?

Ruixin - Which countries had the highest cumulative deaths?

Ethan - What is the relationship between positivity and testing rates across different regions and how does this relationship change throughout phases of the pandemic

? - Is there a relationship between hospitalization lag with identification of positive COVID cases, and how does this lag correlate with healthcare infrastructure of a given region

? - To what extent does geolocation contribute to the trajectories of COVID cases in a specific region. Do neighboring countries exhibit similar trends and what factors contribute to these patterns.

? - Make slides, 1 for each question
